# RockPaperScissors

In a game of rock-paper-scissors (RPS), each player chooses to play Rock (R), Paper (P),
or Scissors (S).
The rules are: R beats S; S beats P; and P beats R. We will encode a rock-paper-scissors
game as a list, where the elements are themselves 2-element lists that encode a player's name
and a player's selected move.
